# üñºÔ∏è AI-Powered Image Summary Generator Using BLIP ü§ñ

This Python project utilizes **BLIP (Bootstrapped Language Image Pretraining)**, a cutting-edge Vision-Language Transformer model, to generate detailed and contextually rich descriptions for input images. Leveraging AI and deep learning, the project is capable of understanding and interpreting images, providing meaningful captions that reflect their content.

## üìö Project Overview

The **Image Description Generator** takes an image as input and returns a short, human-readable description. This project demonstrates how to effectively integrate **transformer-based models** to process and understand visual data. The model used in this project is **BLIP**, which enhances image captioning by generating comprehensive textual descriptions.

## üöÄ Features

- **AI-Powered Image Understanding**: Generate accurate, detailed descriptions for any input image.
- **State-of-the-Art Model**: Uses BLIP, a powerful Vision-Language Transformer model for high-quality caption generation.
- **GPU Acceleration**: Leverages CUDA for faster model inference on supported devices.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: Simple Python functions to load images, generate descriptions, and display results.
